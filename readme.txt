PythonFlashCard.py

PythonFlashCard is a memory game using data from Learning Python the Hard Way (LPTHW).  The author adamantly recommends using flash cards to learn command line commands and python commands.  I knew that I'd lose the cards or just wouldn't keep them updated.  So, a good first project was to create a short script that would read a line from a library at random, show me the description of the command and then give me a small pat on the back if I entered the command correctly.

Instructions:
- put PythonFlashCard.py and FlashCardLibrary.txt in the same directory
- run the program by typing "python PythonFlashCard.py"
- Valid entries
-- quit:  quits the program and returns you to the command line
-- help:  displays the answer
-- or you can simply enter the reqeusted command

Philosophy:
There are lots of possible extensions to this code.  One could keep score.  One could offer pithy words of encouragement or taunting at correct or incorrect answers.  However given that I'd finished only 10 or 15 of the LPTHW exercises by the time that I wrote this I didn't (and couldn't) make the program very complex.  This is for beginning Python students so there is utility in simplicity.

Feel free to make edits or add features to the py file and feel free to add rows to FlashCardLibrary.txt but always remember that you can run back to this initial commit of PythonFlashCard.py and get a very simple program to play with and to study with.

enjoy,
cj
